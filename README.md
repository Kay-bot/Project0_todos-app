Instruction how to use this My Todo's applicaiton: 
1. Enter your task in the entry field (the field where it says "Enter your todo here"). Then, press enter or return in the keyboard. 
2. Tick a checkbox to complete the task.
3. Click a trash icon to delete the task. 
4. Click an info icon to assign priority leve and set due date.

Unsolved problems: 
1. Having to click refresh url everytime after saved changes otherwise it won't be able to click the info button to popup modal box. 
2. While manage to get text from the original task list to be appearred on modal box, but cannot get date and priority to display if click the item in the next time round. 
3. Some small features stop working after adding codes in JS or mark-up in HTML and CSS (i.e. Cursor pointer stoping working when improving the other features)
4. Some features won't work on mobile phone (i.e. when toggle checkbox to complete the task, text-decoration is not working)


Could have but won't have this time: 
1. Word-wrap or limit characters in the input field. 
2. Firebase storage
3. Reminder texts for close due tasks. 
4. Hidden info and trash icons only appear when mouse enter. 
5. Drag and drop to re-order the lists. 
6. Tasks counter
7. Hide/archive completed items
